//: # B1. School Gate â€¢ [10m]
//: Joe has been tasked to write algorithms for a new school gate.
//: The school gate should unlock when **any** of the following conditions are met:
//:
//: * It is within operating hours **and** a student taps their pass.
//: * A teacher taps their pass.
//: * There is a fire.
//:
//: The following assumptions can also be made:
//:
//: * It is impossible for a person to have both a Student pass and a Teacher pass.
//: * The variable names describe the situation at a given moment.

//: To determine if a given time is within operating hours, the school gate also requires an internal timer that tracks seconds elapsed (passed) since the start of the day.
//:
//: 2. Assuming the day starts when the program runs, write a program to keep track of the number of seconds elapsed (passed), printing the value every second. `[5m]`
