//: # B1. School Gate â€¢ [10m]
//: Joe has been tasked to write algorithms for a new school gate. To do so, he is given several inputs as constants.
//:
//: The school gate should unlock when **any** of the following conditions are met:
//:
//: * It is within operating hours **and** a student taps their pass.
//: * A teacher taps their pass.
//: * There is a fire.
//:
//: > He may use the following assumptions and guidelines to aid him:
//: > * It is impossible for a person to have both a Student pass and a Teacher pass.
//: > * The variable names describe the situation at a given moment.
//: > * Setting `isUnlocked` to `true` unlocks the gate.
//: > * To test his code, he may change the values of the constants below, referring to the test cases provided.

//: To determine if a given time is within operating hours, the school gate also requires an internal timer that tracks seconds elapsed since beginning of day.
//:
//: 2. Assuming the day starts when the program runs, write a program to keep track of the time elapsed, printing the value every second. `[5m]`
