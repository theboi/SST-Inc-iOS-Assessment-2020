//: Rick Astley wants to create a new app for his fans to watch his top hits. You have been tasked to create the user interface based on some design specifications.
//:
//: 1. Create a new iOS App (use Swift and Storyboard) with `Xcode.app`. Save it in the directory you previously downloaded. Open `Main.storyboard` and create the user interface based on the specifications found [here](https://www.sketch.com/s/a3ba55be-5987-475a-a727-68722bc8d8f1/a/onvVW5). `[18m]`
//:
//: > As much as possible, make use of Apple's UI Elements (that you have learnt).
//: > Ensure your storyboards work on different iPhone screen sizes.
//: > No coding is required, only edit `Main.storyboard`.
