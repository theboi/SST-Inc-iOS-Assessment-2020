//: > * There are 2 screenshots below. The first image shows the user interface of the app. The second image shows the wireframe annotated with the corresponding `UIKit` elements.
//: > * The image used in the screenshot is `ricks_feet.png`. The image can be found in the test folder. You will be required to use that image in your app.
//: > * As much as possible, make use of Apple's UI Elements (that you have learnt).
//: > * Ensure your storyboards work on different iPhone screen sizes.
//: > * **No coding is required**, only edit `Main.storyboard`.
//: > * Save your project in the Swift Test folder.
