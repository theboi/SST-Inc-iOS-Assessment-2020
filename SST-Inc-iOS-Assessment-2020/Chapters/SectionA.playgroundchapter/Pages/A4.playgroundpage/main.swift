//: # A4. FizzBuzz • [6m]
//: FizzBuzz is a classic programming test, commonly used in coding interviews, to determine whether a given candidate is able to code.
//:
//: - Important: The conditions are slightly modified from the classic FizzBuzz question.
//:
//: * Callout(Conditions):
//:     * For every multiple of 3, print -> `"Fizz"`.
//:     * For every multiple of 4, print -> `"Buzz"`.
//:     * If it is a multiple of both 3 **and** 4 -> `"FizzBuzz"`.
//:     * If it is none of the above, print the number itself.
//:
//: + Callout(Sample Input/Output):
//:     - When number = 1, return "1"
//:     - When number = 6, return "Fizz"
//:     - When number = 8, return "Buzz"
//:     - When number = 12, return "FizzBuzz"
//:
//: 1. Create a function called `fizzBuzz` which takes a parameter `number` of type `Int` and returns a `String` ("Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself) based on the conditions above. Refer to the sample Input/Output. `[4m]`

//: 2. Hence, **using the function you created above**, print out the corresponding values when the numbers 1 to 50 are input, each on a new line. `[2m]`
//:
//: ```
//: 1
//: 2
//: Fizz
//: Buzz
//: …
//: ```
