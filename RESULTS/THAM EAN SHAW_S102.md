### Section A

<details>
<summary><strong>A1. Variables and Constants â€¢ [3/5]</strong></summary>

1. Create a variable, called `rickrolls`, and set it to the number of times you have been rick-rolled by your fellow iOS teachers (any number works). `[1m]`

```swift
var rickrolls = 0
```

> 1m

---

2. Create a constant of the type `Double`, called `magicNumber`, and set it to `3`. `[2m]`

```swift
var magicNumber = 3.0
```

> 0m. It is not a Constant, and its not of type 'Double'

---

3. What is the difference between a variable and a constant? `[2m]`

```txt
A variable is not a constant and can change in value while a constant stays consistent throughout.
```

> Benefit of Doubt (BOD) 2m.

struct Teacher {
    var (name: "Ryan"; "Joe"; "Joshua"; "Ethan")

print ("Joshua is the best")
print ("Ethan is the best")
```

> 0m.

<summary><strong>A4. FizzBuzz â€¢ [0/6]</strong></summary>

1. Create a function called `fizzBuzz` which takes a parameter `number` of type `Int` and returns a `String` ("Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself) based on the conditions above. Refer to the sample Input/Output. `[4m]`

```swift
func fizzBuzz() {
    if Int = 3; 6; 9; 15; 18; 21; 27; 30; 33; 39; 42; 45 {
        print("Fizz")

        print("FizzBuzz")
    }
    
}
```
