### Section A

<details>
<summary><strong>A1. Variables and Constants â€¢ [5/5]</strong></summary>

1. Create a variable, called `rickrolls`, and set it to the number of times you have been rick-rolled by your fellow iOS teachers (any number works). `[1m]`

```swift
var rickrolls = 100
```

> 1m

---

2. Create a constant of the type `Double`, called `magicNumber`, and set it to `3`. `[2m]`

```swift
let magicNumber: Double = 3
```

> 2m

---

3. What is the difference between a variable and a constant? `[2m]`

```txt
Answer: A variable is able to be changed throughout the code while a constant is unable to change and will remain constant.
```

> 2m

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A2. Manipulation of Values â€¢ [0/3]</strong></summary>

1. `(x + x)` as a `String`. `[1m]`

```swift
print("I hate \(x + x) people")
```

> 0m

---

2. `x`Â²Â¹. `[1m]`

```swift

```

> 0m

3. Last digit of `x`. `[1m]`

```swift
print(0)
```

> 0m

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A3. Collections and Objects â€¢ [4/6]</strong></summary>

1. Define a structure (struct) called `Teacher` with the properties: `name`, `wearsGlasses`, and an **optional** value: `watchColor`, with the most appropriate types based on the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
struct Teacher {
    var name: String
    var wearsGlasses: Bool 
    var watchColor: String
}
```

> 1m

---

2. Create an array called `teachers` containing multiple instances of `Teacher` using the details provided in the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
var teachers = [Teacher(name:"Ryan", wearsGlasses: true, watchColor: "Black"), Teacher(name:"Joe", wearsGlasses: false, watchColor:"Pink"), Teacher(name:"Joshua", wearsGlasses:true, watchColor:"-"), Teacher(name:"Ethan", wearsGlasses:true, watchColor: "Grey")]
```

> 2m

---

3. For each `name` in the array declared previously, add `" is the best"` to the end of the `name`, and print it out individually. `[2m]`

```swift
print(teachers.first!.name.appending(" is the best"))
print(teachers[2].name.appending(" is the best"))
print(teachers[3].name.appending(" is the best"))
print(teachers.last!.name.appending(" is the best"))
```

<details>
<summary><strong>A4. FizzBuzz â€¢ [0/6]</strong></summary>

1. Create a function called `fizzBuzz` which takes a parameter `number` of type `Int` and returns a `String` ("Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself) based on the conditions above. Refer to the sample Input/Output. `[4m]`

```swift

```

> 0m

---

2. Hence, **using the function you created above**, print out the corresponding values when the numbers 1 to 50 are input, each on a new line. `[2m]`

```swift

```

> 0m

```swift

```

> 0m

---

2. Adjust the `contentMode` value of the image such that the entire image can be viewed, without getting cropped, while keeping the aspect ratio (not stretched/squashed). `[1m]`

```swift

```

> 0m

---

3. What is the difference between `UIImageView` and `UIImage`? Why are we unable to use them interchangeably? `[1m]`

Answer:
```

### Section B

<details>
<summary><strong>B1. School Gate â€¢ [2/10]</strong></summary>

1. Given the variables above, write a set of conditions that tell the gate whether or not to unlock. `[5m]`

```swift
let withinOperatingHours = true
let isStudentPass = false
let isTeacherPass = false
let isFire = false
var isUnlocked = false

if isTeacherPass == false {
    isUnlocked == true 
} else if isFire == false {
    isUnlocked == true
} else if isStudentPass == true && withinOperatingHours == true {
    isUnlocked == true
} else {
    isUnlocked == false
}
```

> 2m

---

2. Assuming the day starts when the program runs, write a program to keep track of the number of seconds elapsed (passed), printing the value every second. `[5m]`

```swift

```

> 0m

<details>
<summary><strong>B2. Leap Years â€¢ [5/9]</strong></summary>

1. Kesler's bugged code is shown below. There are **5 errors** present. Fix them. `[5m]`

```swift
func isLeap(year: Int) -> Bool { // 1m
    
    var isLeap = true // 2m
    
    if year / 4 == 0 { // 0m
        
        isLeap = true
        
        if year % 100 == 0 {
            
            isLeap = year % 400 == Int(0.0) // 0m
            
        }
    }
    
    return isLeap
}
```

> 3m

---

2. What is this feature called? How is it useful? How can Kesler get rid of it? `[2m]`

```txt
Answer:You can click on it and drag it to the right to remove it and it stops the code wherever it is placed so it helps you to check your code if it is working fine until where it is meant to stop. It is called a breakpoint.
```

3. What might have caused the SIGABRT error, assuming that the app ran fine before he edited his Storyboard? Is a SIGTERM error the same as a SIGABRT error? When does a SIGTERM error occur. `[2m]`

```txt
Answer:The code was not connected to the component on the app correctly so it is unable to run which causes a SIGABRT error. However, a SIGTERM error is not the same as a SIGABRT error because it happens when you mispelled the term that is connected to the component on the app as a IBACTION or OUTLET.

<summary><strong>B3. iClicker Pro Max Plus Ultra 5GS+ â€¢ [1/9]</strong></summary>

1. Label is to be set to your name when the program runs initially. `[1m]`
2. Border radius of the button is to be set to `15`. `[1m]`
3. Background color of the button should change to a random color each time the button is pressed. `[2m]`
4. Label should display the number of times the button has been clicked whenever the button is tapped. `[1m]`
5. Every 17 clicks,
    * Label should be set to the time in seconds since the first click, e.g. `"30s"`. `[2m]`
    * Text on the button is to be set to `"Yay"` (Hint: The correct answer requires setting text for the `.normal` state). `[1m]`
    * Reset the text on the button back to +1 after the next click. `[1m]`

```swift
/// You may declare any variables you may require here.
var count = 0 // 1m
// type code here

public func viewDidLoad() {
    /// Treat this function as your typical `viewDidLoad()`.
    // type code here
    print("Angel") 
    
}

public func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    /// Treat this function as your typical `viewDidAppear(_:)`.
    // type code here
    
}

public func onButtonPress() {
    /// Treat this function as your typical `@IBAction` which is linked to the button.
    // type code here
    button.layer.cornerRadius = 15
    count += 1 // 1m
    }
