#  SST-Inc-iOS-Assessment-2020 Results

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations

Congratulations on completing your Swift Assessment, and *hopefully* your journey in the SST Inc Swift Course. Regrettably, those who have failed this assessment will require further learning before moving on. An email will be sent to you separately with more details should you *qualify*.

Refer to the mark sheet if you are doubtful of the accuracy of marking. If you believe we made a mistake (not impossible, we are humans too ðŸ’©), feel free to email us or add a private comment in Google Classroom.

**Total Score: 27/70**

### Section A

<details>
<summary><strong>A1. Variables and Constants â€¢ [3/5]</strong></summary>

1. Create a variable, called `rickrolls`, and set it to the number of times you have been rick-rolled by your fellow iOS teachers (any number works). `[1m]`

```swift
var rickrolls = 5
```

> 1m

---

2. Create a constant of the type `Double`, called `magicNumber`, and set it to `3`. `[2m]`

```swift
let magicNumber = 3.0
```

> 0m

---

3. What is the difference between a variable and a constant? `[2m]`

```txt
Answer: variables can be changed but constants always remain the same
```

> 2m

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A2. Manipulation of Values â€¢ [0/3]</strong></summary>

1. `(x + x)` as a `String`. `[1m]`

```swift
var y = x+x
print(y: String)
```

> 0m

---

2. `x`Â²Â¹. `[1m]`

```swift
var y = x^21
print(y: String)
```

> 0m

---

3. Last digit of `x`. `[1m]`

```swift
var y = x.last
print(y: String)
```

> 0m

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A3. Collections and Objects â€¢ [3/6]</strong></summary>

1. Define a structure (struct) called `Teacher` with the properties: `name`, `wearsGlasses`, and an **optional** value: `watchColor`, with the most appropriate types based on the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
struct teacher {
    name,
    wearsGlasses,
    watchColor
}
```

> 1m Structure created

---

2. Create an array called `teachers` containing multiple instances of `Teacher` using the details provided in the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
let teachers = [teacher(name = "Ryan", wearsGlasses = "Yes", watchColor = "Black"), teacher(name = "Joe", wearsGlasses = "No", watchColor = "Pink"), teacher(name = "Joshua", wearsGlasses = "Yes", watchColor = "--"), teacher(name = "Ethan", wearsGlasses = "Yes", watchColor = "Grey")] 
```

> 1m

---

3. For each `name` in the array declared previously, add `" is the best"` to the end of the `name`, and print it out individually. `[2m]`

```swift
for i in teachers{
    print("\(name) is the best")
}
```

> 1m

<details>
<summary><strong>A4. FizzBuzz â€¢ [4/6]</strong></summary>

1. Create a function called `fizzBuzz` which takes a parameter `number` of type `Int` and returns a `String` ("Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself) based on the conditions above. Refer to the sample Input/Output. `[4m]`

```swift
func fizzBuzz(_: number){
    if number%3 == 0 && number%4 == 0{ 
        return "FizzBuzz"
    }else if number%4 == 0{
        return "Buzz"
    }else if number%3 == 0{
        return "Fizz"
    }else{
        return number
    }
} 
```

> 3m

---

2. Hence, **using the function you created above**, print out the corresponding values when the numbers 1 to 50 are input, each on a new line. `[2m]`

```swift
for i in 1 ... 50 {
    print(fizzBuzz(i))
}
```

> 1m

<details>
<summary><strong>A5. A Thousand Words â€¢ [1/3]</strong></summary>

1. Given an image view, `imageView`, and an image called `wheres_waldo` in `Assets.xcassets`, display the image. `[1m]`

```swift
imageView.image = Assets.xcassets/wheres_waldo.png
```

> 0m

---

2. Adjust the `contentMode` value of the image such that the entire image can be viewed, without getting cropped, while keeping the aspect ratio (not stretched/squashed). `[1m]`

```swift
imageView.contentMode = "fill"
```

> 0m

---

3. What is the difference between `UIImageView` and `UIImage`? Why are we unable to use them interchangeably? `[1m]`

```txt
Answer: UIImageView is a place to display a variable image while UIImage is a fixed image
```

> 1m

</details>

### Section B

<details>
<summary><strong>B1. School Gate â€¢ [3/10]</strong></summary>

1. Given the variables above, write a set of conditions that tell the gate whether or not to unlock. `[5m]`

```swift
let withinOperatingHours = false
let isStudentPass = false
let isTeacherPass = false
let isFire = false
var isUnlocked = false

if withinOperatingHours = false && isStudentPass = false && isTeacherPass = false && isFire = false{
    isUnlocked = false
}else if withinOperatingHours = false && isStudentPass = false && isTeacherPass = false && isFire = true{
    isUnlocked = true
}else if withinOperatingHours = true && isStudentPass = true && isTeacherPass = false && isFire = false{
    isUnlocked = true
}else if withinOperatingHours = false && isStudentPass = false && isTeacherPass = true && isFire = false{
    isUnlocked = true
}
```

2. Assuming the day starts when the program runs, write a program to keep track of the number of seconds elapsed (passed), printing the value every second. `[5m]`

```swift

```

<details>
<summary><strong>B2. Leap Years â€¢ [3/9]</strong></summary>

1. Kesler's bugged code is shown below. There are **5 errors** present. Fix them. `[5m]`

```swift
func isLeap(year: Int){
    if year % 4 == 0{
        isLeap = false
    }else if year % 100 == 0{
        isLeap = year % 400 == 0
    }
    return isLeap
    
}
```

> 2m

---

2. What is this feature called? How is it useful? How can Kesler get rid of it? `[2m]`

```txt
Answer:this feature is useful as it shows the result of the function, thus allowing kesler to check if his code is correct
```

> 0m

3. What might have caused the SIGABRT error, assuming that the app ran fine before he edited his Storyboard? Is a SIGTERM error the same as a SIGABRT error? When does a SIGTERM error occur. `[2m]`

```txt
Answer: kesler may have changed one of the components that should not be chnaged in the storyboard
```

<summary><strong>B3. iClicker Pro Max Plus Ultra 5GS+ â€¢ [1/9]</strong></summary>

1. Label is to be set to your name when the program runs initially. `[1m]`
2. Border radius of the button is to be set to `15`. `[1m]`
3. Background color of the button should change to a random color each time the button is pressed. `[2m]`
4. Label should display the number of times the button has been clicked whenever the button is tapped. `[1m]`
5. Every 17 clicks,
    * Label should be set to the time in seconds since the first click, e.g. `"30s"`. `[2m]`
    * Text on the button is to be set to `"Yay"` (Hint: The correct answer requires setting text for the `.normal` state). `[1m]`
    * Reset the text on the button back to +1 after the next click. `[1m]`

```swift
/// You may declare any variables you may require here.

// type code here

//
//

public func viewDidLoad() {
    /// Treat this function as your typical `viewDidLoad()`.
    // type code here
    label.text = "anjali" // 1m
    button.borderRadius = 15 // 0m
}

public func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    /// Treat this function as your typical `viewDidAppear(_:)`.
    // type code here
    
}

var clicktimes = 1
public func onButtonPress() {
    /// Treat this function as your typical `@IBAction` which is linked to the button.
    // type code here
    button.color = random // 0m
    clicktimes += 1 
    label.text = clicktimes // 0m Did not string interpolate
}

// 0  no timer

if clicktimes == 17{
    label.text = time // 0m
    botton.normal = "Yay" // 0m
    clicktimes = 1
}
```
