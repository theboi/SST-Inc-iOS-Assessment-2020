#  SST-Inc-iOS-Assessment-2020 Results

## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations

Congratulations on completing your Swift Assessment, and *hopefully* your journey in the SST Inc Swift Course. Regrettably, those who have failed this assessment will require further learning before moving on. An email will be sent to you separately with more details should you *qualify*.

Refer to the mark sheet if you are  doubtful of the accuracy of marking. If you believe we made a mistake (not impossible, we are humans too ðŸ’©), feel free to email us or add a private comment in Google Classroom.

**Total Score: 28/70**

### Section A

<details>
<summary><strong>A1. Variables and Constants â€¢ [5/5]</strong></summary>

1. Create a variable, called `rickrolls`, and set it to the number of times you have been rick-rolled by your fellow iOS teachers (any number works). `[1m]`

```swift
var rickrolls = 10
```

> 1m

---

2. Create a constant of the type `Double`, called `magicNumber`, and set it to `3`. `[2m]`

```swift
let magicNumber : Double = 3
```

> 2m

---

3. What is the difference between a variable and a constant? `[2m]`

```txt
"""
Answer: variables can be changed whereas constants cannot 
"""
```

> 2m

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A2. Manipulation of Values â€¢ [0/3]</strong></summary>

1. `(x + x)` as a `String`. `[1m]`

```swift

```

> 0m

---

2. `x`Â²Â¹. `[1m]`

```swift

```

> 0m

---

3. Last digit of `x`. `[1m]`

```swift
var lastDigit = x%69420
print(lastDigit)
```

> 0m

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A3. Collections and Objects â€¢ [2/6]</strong></summary>

1. Define a structure (struct) called `Teacher` with the properties: `name`, `wearsGlasses`, and an **optional** value: `watchColor`, with the most appropriate types based on the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
struct Teacher{
    var name 
}
``` 

> 1m Teacher structure created, variables not declared properly

---

2. Create an array called `teachers` containing multiple instances of `Teacher` using the details provided in the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
var teachersArray = ["Ryan"]
```

> 1m Array created, not instantiated with collect details

---

3. For each `name` in the array declared previously, add `" is the best"` to the end of the `name`, and print it out individually. `[2m]`

```swift

```

> 0m

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A4. FizzBuzz â€¢ [2/6]</strong></summary>

1. Create a function called `fizzBuzz` which takes a parameter `number` of type `Int` and returns a `String` ("Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself) based on the conditions above. Refer to the sample Input/Output. `[4m]`

```swift
var number = 12
func fizzBuzz(_: Int) {
    
    if number % 3 == 0 && number % 4 == 0{
        print("fizzBuzz")
    }
    else{
        if number % 3 == 0{
            print("fizz")
        }
        if number % 4 == 0{
            print("buzz")
        }
    }
    
    if number % 3 != 0 && number % 4 != 0{
        print(number)
    }
    
    
}
```

> 1m Correctly identifies all cases

---

2. Hence, **using the function you created above**, print out the corresponding values when the numbers 1 to 50 are input, each on a new line. `[2m]`

```swift
for i in 1 ... 50 {
    number = 0
    number += 1
    fizzBuzz(1)
}
```

> 1m For loop used

<details>
<summary><strong>A5. A Thousand Words â€¢ [0/3]</strong></summary>

1. Given an image view, `imageView`, and an image called `wheres_waldo` in `Assets.xcassets`, display the image. `[1m]`

```swift
var wheres_waldo :String = "wheres_waldo"
```

>  0m

---

2. Adjust the `contentMode` value of the image such that the entire image can be viewed, without getting cropped, while keeping the aspect ratio (not stretched/squashed). `[1m]`

```swift

```

> 0m

---

3. What is the difference between `UIImageView` and `UIImage`? Why are we unable to use them interchangeably? `[1m]`

```txt
"""
Answer: UIImageView can show a series of images as an animation whereas UIImage cannot
"""
```

> 0m

</details>

### Section B

<details>
<summary><strong>B1. School Gate â€¢ [2/10]</strong></summary>

1. Given the variables above, write a set of conditions that tell the gate whether or not to unlock. `[5m]`

```swift
let withinOperatingHours = false
let isStudentPass = false
let isTeacherPass = false
let isFire = false
var isUnlocked = false
if isFire == false {
    isUnlocked = false
    if isTeacherPass == false {
        isUnlocked = false
    }
    
    if withinOperatingHours == true {
        isUnlocked = false
        if isStudentPass == false {
            isUnlocked = false
        }
        
    }
}
```

> 1m if condition used

---

2. Assuming the day starts when the program runs, write a program to keep track of the number of seconds elapsed (passed), printing the value every second. `[5m]`

```swift
Timer.scheduledTimer(timeInterval: 1, invocation: nil
```

> 1m any usage of Timer closure

<summary><strong>B2. Leap Years â€¢ [5/9]</strong></summary>

1. Kesler's bugged code is shown below. There are **5 errors** present. Fix them. `[5m]`

```swift
func isLeap(year: Int) -> Bool { // 1m
    
    // 1m
    var isLeap : Bool = true // 0m
    
    if year / 4 == 0 { // 0m
        
        isLeap = true
        
        if year % 100 == 0 {
            
            isLeap = false
            if year % 400 == 0{ // 1m
                isLeap = true
            }
            
        }
    }
    
    return isLeap
}
```

> 2m

2. What is this feature called? How is it useful? How can Kesler get rid of it? `[2m]`

```txt
"""
Answer: The feature is called breakpoints. You can use it to test sections of your app and to remove it, right click the breakpoint then click delete the breakpoint
"""
```

> 2m

3. What might have caused the SIGABRT error, assuming that the app ran fine before he edited his Storyboard? Is a SIGTERM error the same as a SIGABRT error? When does a SIGTERM error occur. `[2m]`

```txt
"""
Answer: He likely deleted something on the storyboard that was connected to his code, and SIGTERM error is not the same as a SIGABRT error. A SIGTERM error occurs because idk
""" 
```

> 1m SIGTERM does not occur because idk

<summary><strong>B3. iClicker Pro Max Plus Ultra 5GS+ â€¢ [3/9]</strong></summary>

1. Label is to be set to your name when the program runs initially. `[1m]`
2. Border radius of the button is to be set to `15`. `[1m]`
3. Background color of the button should change to a random color each time the button is pressed. `[2m]`
4. Label should display the number of times the button has been clicked whenever the button is tapped. `[1m]`
5. Every 17 clicks,
    * Label should be set to the time in seconds since the first click, e.g. `"30s"`. `[2m]`
    * Text on the button is to be set to `"Yay"` (Hint: The correct answer requires setting text for the `.normal` state). `[1m]`
    * Reset the text on the button back to +1 after the next click. `[1m]`

```swift
/// You may declare any variables you may require here.
var Alone : String = "Alonzo"
var points = 0
// type code here
if points == 17 {
    <#code#>
} // 0m

public func viewDidLoad() {
    /// Treat this function as your typical `viewDidLoad()`.
    // type code here
    // 0m
}

public func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    /// Treat this function as your typical `viewDidAppear(_:)`.
    // type code here
    label.text = Alone
}

public func onButtonPress() {
    /// Treat this function as your typical `@IBAction` which is linked to the button.
    // type code here
    
    // 0m
    
    points += 1
