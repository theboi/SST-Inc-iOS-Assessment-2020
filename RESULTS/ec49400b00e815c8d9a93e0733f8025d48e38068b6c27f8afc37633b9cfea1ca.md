let magicNumber = Double(); 3
```
*Wrong (0m)*

<summary><strong>A4. FizzBuzz â€¢ [0/6]</strong></summary>

1. Create a function called `fizzBuzz` which takes a parameter `number` of type `Int` and returns a `String` ("Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself) based on the conditions above. Refer to the sample Input/Output. `[4m]`

```swift
var number = 1
func fizzBuzz(number:Double) {
    if number / 3 == 0.0
    {print("Fizz")
        var m3 = true
        if number / 4 == 0.0
    {print("Buzz")
            var m4 = true

    if m3 && m4 == true{
        print("FizzBuzz")


    if m3 && m4 == false
        {print(number)

        }
    }}}
}

<summary><strong>B2. Leap Years â€¢ [6/9]</strong></summary>

1. Kesler's bugged code is shown below. There are **5 errors** present. Fix them. `[5m]`

```swift
func isLeap(year: Int) -> Bool  { // M1

    var isLeap = true // M1

    if year / 4 == 0 {
        isLeap = true
        if year % 100 == 0

        {isLeap = year % 400 == Int(0.0) // BOD M1
            isLeap = true }

    }


    return isLeap
}
```

*M1, M2, M3 (3m)*

---

2. What is this feature called? How is it useful? How can Kesler get rid of it? `[2m]`

Breakpoints. It can help stop your code at a spesific point. Hold and drage the breakpoint to the left and let go.

*Correct (2m)*

3. What might have caused the SIGABRT error, assuming that the app ran fine before he edited his Storyboard? Is a SIGTERM error the same as a SIGABRT error? When does a SIGTERM error occur. `[2m]`

He might have deleted the the code that is used for the conections eg(@IBOutlet) but did not remove the connection and wrote a new code. (BOD 1m)
A SIGTERM error is not the same as a SIGABRT error.
