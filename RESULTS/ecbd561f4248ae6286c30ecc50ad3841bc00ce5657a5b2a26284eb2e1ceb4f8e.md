## ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations

Congratulations on completing your Swift Assessment, and *hopefully* your journey in the SST Inc Swift Course. Regrettably, those who have failed this assessment will require further learning before moving on. An email will be sent to you separately with more details should you *qualify*.

Refer to the mark sheet if you are doubtful of the accuracy of marking. If you believe we made a mistake (not impossible, we are humans too ðŸ’©), feel free to email us or add a private comment in Google Classroom.

### Section A

<details>
<summary><strong>A1. Variables and Constants â€¢ [5/5]</strong></summary>

1. Create a variable, called `rickrolls`, and set it to the number of times you have been rick-rolled by your fellow iOS teachers (any number works). `[1m]`

```swift
var rickrolls = 2
```

> 1m

---

2. Create a constant of the type `Double`, called `magicNumber`, and set it to `3`. `[2m]`

```swift
let magicNumber : Double
magicNumber = 3.0

```

> 2m

---

3. What is the difference between a variable and a constant? `[2m]`

```
"""
Answer: Variable can be changed while a constant cannot be changed
"""
```

> 2m

<details>
<summary><strong>A2. Manipulation of Values â€¢ [0/3]</strong></summary>

1. `(x + x)` as a `String`. `[1m]`

```swift
var answer1 : String
var temp = x + x
(String)(temp)
print(temp)
```

> 0m

---

2. `x`Â²Â¹. `[1m]`

```swift
var answer = x^21

print (answer)
```

> 0m

3. Last digit of `x`. `[1m]`

```swift
for i in x ... 4 {
    print (i)
}
```

> 0m

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A3. Collections and Objects â€¢ [1/6]</strong></summary>

1. Define a structure (struct) called `Teacher` with the properties: `name`, `wearsGlasses`, and an **optional** value: `watchColor`, with the most appropriate types based on the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
struct Teacher {
    var name : String
    var wearsGlasses: String
    var watchColour : String
}
```

> 1m

---

2. Create an array called `teachers` containing multiple instances of `Teacher` using the details provided in the table above. `[2m]`

```swift

```

> 0m

---

3. For each `name` in the array declared previously, add `" is the best"` to the end of the `name`, and print it out individually. `[2m]`

```swift

```

> 0m

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A4. FizzBuzz â€¢ [2/6]</strong></summary>

1. Create a function called `fizzBuzz` which takes a parameter `number` of type `Int` and returns a `String` ("Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself) based on the conditions above. Refer to the sample Input/Output. `[4m]`

```swift
var number : Int
func fizzBuzz(){
    if number % 3 == 0{
        print ("Fizz")
    }
    if number % 4 == 0{
        print ("Buzz")
    }
    if number & 12 == 0 {
        print ("FizzBuzz")
    }
}
```

> 2m

---

2. Hence, **using the function you created above**, print out the corresponding values when the numbers 1 to 50 are input, each on a new line. `[2m]`

```swift
number = 1
repeat {
    fizzBuzz()
    number = number + 1
} while number <= 50

```

> 0m

<details>
<summary><strong>A5. A Thousand Words â€¢ [1/3]</strong></summary>

1. Given an image view, `imageView`, and an image called `wheres_waldo` in `Assets.xcassets`, display the image. `[1m]`

```swift
// IDK how to do
```

> 0m

---

2. Adjust the `contentMode` value of the image such that the entire image can be viewed, without getting cropped, while keeping the aspect ratio (not stretched/squashed). `[1m]`

```swift
// IDK how to do
```

> 0m

---

3. What is the difference between `UIImageView` and `UIImage`? Why are we unable to use them interchangeably? `[1m]`

```txt
"""
These both are different because one is viewing the image and one is refering only to the image
"""
```

> 1m

</details>

### Section B

<details>
<summary><strong>B1. School Gate â€¢ [4/10]</strong></summary>

1. Given the variables above, write a set of conditions that tell the gate whether or not to unlock. `[5m]`

```swift
let withinOperatingHours = false
let isStudentPass = false
let isTeacherPass = false
let isFire = false
var isUnlocked = false

if withinOperatingHours == true && isStudentPass == true{
    isUnlocked = true
}
if isTeacherPass == true {
    isUnlocked = true
}
if isFire == true {
    isUnlocked = true
}
```

> 3m

---

2. Assuming the day starts when the program runs, write a program to keep track of the number of seconds elapsed (passed), printing the value every second. `[5m]`

```swift
var timeElasped : Int
timeElasped = 0
var temp = true
repeat {
    timeElasped = timeElasped + 1
    print ((timeElasped)," s ")
} while temp == true
```

<summary><strong>B2. Leap Years â€¢ [5/9]</strong></summary>

1. Kesler's bugged code is shown below. There are **5 errors** present. Fix them. `[5m]`

```swift
func isLeap(year: Int) -> Bool { // 1. Set return type to Bool
    var isLeap = true // 2. Change let to var. 3. Change true to false
    if ((year % 4) == 0) && ((year % 100) != 0), {
        isLeap = true
    }{}
    if ((year % 400) == 0) { // 5. Replace 0.0 with 0, because Int
            isLeap = true
        }
    
    
    return isLeap
}
```

2. What is this feature called? How is it useful? How can Kesler get rid of it? `[2m]`

```txt
"""
Answer: Breakpoints. To get rid of them Right Click and select delete breakpoint
"""
```

3. What might have caused the SIGABRT error, assuming that the app ran fine before he edited his Storyboard? Is a SIGTERM error the same as a SIGABRT error? When does a SIGTERM error occur. `[2m]`

```txt
"""
Answer: he close the simuluter causing xcode to report the crash. No Sigterm is Different from Sigabrt Error. Sigterm error occers when he

<summary><strong>B3. iClicker Pro Max Plus Ultra 5GS+ â€¢ [1/9]</strong></summary>

1. Label is to be set to your name when the program runs initially. `[1m]`
2. Border radius of the button is to be set to `15`. `[1m]`
3. Background color of the button should change to a random color each time the button is pressed. `[2m]`
4. Label should display the number of times the button has been clicked whenever the button is tapped. `[1m]`
5. Every 17 clicks,
    * Label should be set to the time in seconds since the first click, e.g. `"30s"`. `[2m]`
    * Text on the button is to be set to `"Yay"` (Hint: The correct answer requires setting text for the `.normal` state). `[1m]`
    * Reset the text on the button back to +1 after the next click. `[1m]`

```swift
public func viewDidLoad() {
    UILabel().text = "Daksh"
}

public func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    
}
