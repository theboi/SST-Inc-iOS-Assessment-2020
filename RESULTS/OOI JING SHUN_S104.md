**Total Score: 21/70**

### Section A

<details>
<summary><strong>A1. Variables and Constants â€¢ [5/5]</strong></summary>

1. Create a variable, called `rickrolls`, and set it to the number of times you have been rick-rolled by your fellow iOS teachers (any number works). `[1m]`

```swift
var rickrolls = 69
```

> 1m

---

2. Create a constant of the type `Double`, called `magicNumber`, and set it to `3`. `[2m]`

```swift
let magicNumber: Double = 3
```

> 2m

---

3. What is the difference between a variable and a constant? `[2m]`

```txt
Answer: A variable can be changed whereas a constant cannot be changed.
```

> 2m

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A2. Manipulation of Values â€¢ [2/3]</strong></summary>

1. `(x + x)` as a `String`. `[1m]`

```swift
print("x + x")
```

> 0m. Nice try, if you had printed with the brackets I might have given Benefit of Doubt (BOD)...

---

2. `x`Â²Â¹. `[1m]`

```swift
print(x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x * x)
```

> 1m. You can use `pow()` though

---

3. Last digit of `x`. `[1m]`

```swift
let a: Int = 10
print(x%a)
```

> 1m. `a` not required though, you can directly do `x % 10`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A3. Collections and Objects â€¢ [3/6]</strong></summary>

1. Define a structure (struct) called `Teacher` with the properties: `name`, `wearsGlasses`, and an **optional** value: `watchColor`, with the most appropriate types based on the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
struct Teacher {
    var name: String
    var wearsGlasses: Bool
    var watchColor: String
}
```

> 1m. `watchColor` should be of type `String?`

---

2. Create an array called `teachers` containing multiple instances of `Teacher` using the details provided in the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
let teachers = [Teacher(name: "Ryan", wearsGlasses: true, watchColor: "Black"), Teacher(name: "Joe", wearsGlasses: false, watchColor: "Pink"), Teacher(name: "Joshua", wearsGlasses: true, watchColor: "-"), Teacher(name: "Ethan", wearsGlasses: true, watchColor: "Grey")]
```

> 2m. Error carry forward.

---

3. For each `name` in the array declared previously, add `" is the best"` to the end of the `name`, and print it out individually. `[2m]`

```swift
print(teachers.name[0] "is the best")
```

> 0m. See answer sheet.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A4. FizzBuzz â€¢ [0/6]</strong></summary>

1. Create a function called `fizzBuzz` which takes a parameter `number` of type `Int` and returns a `String` ("Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself) based on the conditions above. Refer to the sample Input/Output. `[4m]`

```swift
func fizzBuzz(var number: Int){
    var three = 0
    var four = 0
    if number % 3 == 0 {
        var three = 1
    }
    if number % 4 == 0 {
        var four = 1
    }
    if (three + four) == 2{
        print("FizzBuzz")
    }else if three == 1{
        print("Fizz")
    }else if four == 1{
        print("Buzz")
    }else{
        print(number)
    }
    
}
```

> 0m. Good try, but code does not work. Main issue it that you created another set of `three` and `four` variables in the `if` statements. Therefore `three` and `four` in the outer function is always `0`. Nice try though.

---

2. Hence, **using the function you created above**, print out the corresponding values when the numbers 1 to 50 are input, each on a new line. `[2m]`

```swift

```

> 0m. Unattempted

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A5. A Thousand Words â€¢ [0/3]</strong></summary>

1. Given an image view, `imageView`, and an image called `wheres_waldo` in `Assets.xcassets`, display the image. `[1m]`

```swift
imageView = wheres_waldo
```

> 0m. See answer sheet

---

2. Adjust the `contentMode` value of the image such that the entire image can be viewed, without getting cropped, while keeping the aspect ratio (not stretched/squashed). `[1m]`

```swift

```

> 0m. Unattempted

---

3. What is the difference between `UIImageView` and `UIImage`? Why are we unable to use them interchangeably? `[1m]`

```txt
Answer: an image in UIImageView can be resized but an image in UIImage cannot
```

> 0m. See answer sheet

</details>

### Section B

<details>
<summary><strong>B1. School Gate â€¢ [4/10]</strong></summary>

1. Given the variables above, write a set of conditions that tell the gate whether or not to unlock. `[5m]`

```swift
var withinOperatingHours = false
let isStudentPass = false
let isTeacherPass = false
let isFire = false
var isUnlocked = false
if withinOperatingHours && isStudentPass == true {
    isUnlocked = true
}
```

> 3m. BOD. See answer sheet.

---

2. Assuming the day starts when the program runs, write a program to keep track of the number of seconds elapsed (passed), printing the value every second. `[5m]`

```swift
var time = 0
```

> 1m. See answer sheet.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>B2. Leap Years â€¢ [3/9]</strong></summary>

1. Kesler's bugged code is shown below. There are **5 errors** present. Fix them. `[5m]`

```swift
func isLeap(year: Int) {
    
    let isLeap = true    // change let to var
    
    if year / 4 == 0 {
        
        isLeap = true
        
        if year % 100 == 0 {
            
            isLeap = year % 400 == 0.0   // change this line of code to "isLeap = false
            
        }
    }
    
    return isLeap   // add this line of code into " if isLeap = true {}"
    
}
```

> 1m. BOD given for changing let to var, though no change was made in code

---

2. What is this feature called? How is it useful? How can Kesler get rid of it? `[2m]`

```txt
Answer: It is a breakpoint, he can right click on it and press delete. This is used when progammers want to debug a programm
```

> 2m.

---

3. What might have caused the SIGABRT error, assuming that the app ran fine before he edited his Storyboard? Is a SIGTERM error the same as a SIGABRT error? When does a SIGTERM error occur. `[2m]`

```txt

```

> 0m. Unattempted.

<summary><strong>B3. iClicker Pro Max Plus Ultra 5GS+ â€¢ [0/9]</strong></summary>

1. Label is to be set to your name when the program runs initially. `[1m]`
2. Border radius of the button is to be set to `15`. `[1m]`
3. Background color of the button should change to a random color each time the button is pressed. `[2m]`
4. Label should display the number of times the button has been clicked whenever the button is tapped. `[1m]`
5. Every 17 clicks,
    * Label should be set to the time in seconds since the first click, e.g. `"30s"`. `[2m]`
    * Text on the button is to be set to `"Yay"` (Hint: The correct answer requires setting text for the `.normal` state). `[1m]`
    * Reset the text on the button back to +1 after the next click. `[1m]`

```swift
/// You may declare any variables you may require here.
var amountClick = 0
var timeSinceFirst = 0 
var labelRandom = "Jing Shun"
// type code here

public func viewDidLoad() {
    /// Treat this function as your typical `viewDidLoad()`.
    // type code here
    label = labelRandom
}

public func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    /// Treat this function as your typical `viewDidAppear(_:)`.
    // type code here
    button.radius = 15
}

public func onButtonPress() {
    /// Treat this function as your typical `@IBAction` which is linked to the button.
    // type code here
    amountClick += 1
    label = amountClick
    
    if amountClick == 17{
        label = timeSinceFirst
        amountClick = 0
    }
    
}
```

<summary><strong>B4. RickTube â€¢ [4/19]</strong></summary>

1. Create a new iOS App (use Swift and Storyboard) with `Xcode.app`. Save it in the test directory you previously downloaded. `[1m]`
2. Open `Main.storyboard` and create the user interface based on the specifications below. `[18m]`

> Created app and made it initial view controller.
