**Total Score: XX/70**

### Section A

<details>
<summary><strong>A1. Variables and Constants â€¢ [5/5]</strong></summary>

1. Create a variable, called `rickrolls`, and set it to the number of times you have been rick-rolled by your fellow iOS teachers (any number works). `[1m]`

```swift
var rickrolls = 3
```

> 1m.

---

2. Create a constant of the type `Double`, called `magicNumber`, and set it to `3`. `[2m]`

```swift
let magicNumber :Double = 3
```

> 2m.

---

3. What is the difference between a variable and a constant? `[2m]`

```txt
Answer: The data in a variable can change but a data in a constant can't
```

> 2m.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A2. Manipulation of Values â€¢ [3/3]</strong></summary>

1. `(x + x)` as a `String`. `[1m]`

```swift
print ("\(x+x)")
```

> 1m.

---

2. `x`Â²Â¹. `[1m]`

```swift
var value = (x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x*x)
print (value)
```

> 1m. Could have used `pow()`

---

3. Last digit of `x`. `[1m]`

```swift
print(value%10)
```

> 1m

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A3. Collections and Objects â€¢ [4/6]</strong></summary>

1. Define a structure (struct) called `Teacher` with the properties: `name`, `wearsGlasses`, and an **optional** value: `watchColor`, with the most appropriate types based on the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
struct Teacher {
    var name : String
    var wearsGlasses : Bool
    var watchColour:[String]?
}
```

> 1m. `watchColour` incorrect type of `[String]?`

---

2. Create an array called `teachers` containing multiple instances of `Teacher` using the details provided in the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
var teachers = ["Ryan","Joe","Joshua","Ethan"]
```

> 1m. See answer sheet.

---

3. For each `name` in the array declared previously, add `" is the best"` to the end of the `name`, and print it out individually. `[2m]`

```swift
var counter = 0
for i in 1...4 {
    print("\(teachers[counter]) is the best")
    counter += 1
}
```

> 2m. Could have used `i` which is provided by the loop instead of `counter`, though still works.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>A4. FizzBuzz â€¢ [X/6]</strong></summary>

1. Create a function called `fizzBuzz` which takes a parameter `number` of type `Int` and returns a `String` ("Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself) based on the conditions above. Refer to the sample Input/Output. `[4m]`

```swift
func FizzBuzz(number: Int){
    if (number%3 == 0)&&(number%4 == 0){
        print("FizzBuzz")
        if (number%3 == 0){
            print("Fizz")
            if (number%4 == 0){
                print("Buzz")
                if (number%3 != 0)&&(number%4 != 0){
                    print(number)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> 1m. The issue is that all your `if` conditions are nested, ie you cannot get to the inner one without first passing the conditions of the outer one. Use `if else` and `else` then correct.

---

2. Hence, **using the function you created above**, print out the corresponding values when the numbers 1 to 50 are input, each on a new line. `[2m]`

```swift
var number = 0
for i in 1...50 {
    number += 1
    func FizzBuzz() {
        if (number%3 == 0)&&(number%4 == 0){
            print("FizzBuzz")
            if (number%3 == 0){
                print("Fizz")
                if (number%4 == 0){
                    print("Buzz")
                    if (number%3 != 0)&&(number%4 != 0){
                        print(number)
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    
}
```

> 0m. Not using function above. See answer sheet.

<summary><strong>A5. A Thousand Words â€¢ [1/3]</strong></summary>

1. Given an image view, `imageView`, and an image called `wheres_waldo` in `Assets.xcassets`, display the image. `[1m]`

```swift

```

> 0m. Unattempted.

---

2. Adjust the `contentMode` value of the image such that the entire image can be viewed, without getting cropped, while keeping the aspect ratio (not stretched/squashed). `[1m]`

```swift

```

> 0m. Unattempted.

---

3. What is the difference between `UIImageView` and `UIImage`? Why are we unable to use them interchangeably? `[1m]`

```txt
Answer: UiImageView is where the image will be display but the UIimage is the image data
```

> 1m.

### Section B

<details>
<summary><strong>B1. School Gate â€¢ [4/10]</strong></summary>

1. Given the variables above, write a set of conditions that tell the gate whether or not to unlock. `[5m]`

```swift
let withinOperatingHours = false
var OperatingHours = false
let isStudentPass = false
var StudentPass = false
let isTeacherPass = false
var TeacherPass = false
let isFire = false
var Fire = false
var isUnlocked = false
OperatingHours = withinOperatingHours
StudentPass = isStudentPass
TeacherPass = isTeacherPass
Fire = isFire
if Fire != false {
    var isUnlocked = true
    if TeacherPass != false {
        var isUnlocked = true
        if ( StudentPass != false)&&(OperatingHours != false){
            var isUnlocked = true
        }
    }
}
```

> 2m. See answer sheet.

---

2. Assuming the day starts when the program runs, write a program to keep track of the number of seconds elapsed (passed), printing the value every second. `[5m]`

```swift
var repeater = 1
var times = 0.0
for i in 1 ... (repeater) {
    repeater += 1
    times += 0.1
    print(times)
}
```

> 2m. No use of `Timer`. See answer sheet.

<details>
<summary><strong>B2. Leap Years â€¢ [4/9]</strong></summary>

1. Kesler's bugged code is shown below. There are **5 errors** present. Fix them. `[5m]`

```swift
func isLeap(year: Int) {   /// 0m
    
    var isLeap = true   /// 1m
    
    if year % 4 == 0 {   /// 1m
        
        isLeap = true
        
        if year % 100 == 0 {
            
            isLeap = year % 400 == 0   /// 1m
            
        }
    }
    
    
}
```

> 3m. See answer sheet.

---

2. What is this feature called? How is it useful? How can Kesler get rid of it? `[2m]`

```txt
Answer: breakpoint, he can right click it and press delete breakpoint
```

> 1m. Did not state purpose.

---

3. What might have caused the SIGABRT error, assuming that the app ran fine before he edited his Storyboard? Is a SIGTERM error the same as a SIGABRT error? When does a SIGTERM error occur. `[2m]`

```txt
Answer: the identity of the storyboard is not the same as the sugey
```

> 0m. What is sugey? See answer sheet.

<summary><strong>B3. iClicker Pro Max Plus Ultra 5GS+ â€¢ [3/9]</strong></summary>

1. Label is to be set to your name when the program runs initially. `[1m]`
2. Border radius of the button is to be set to `15`. `[1m]`
3. Background color of the button should change to a random color each time the button is pressed. `[2m]`
4. Label should display the number of times the button has been clicked whenever the button is tapped. `[1m]`
5. Every 17 clicks,
    * Label should be set to the time in seconds since the first click, e.g. `"30s"`. `[2m]`
    * Text on the button is to be set to `"Yay"` (Hint: The correct answer requires setting text for the `.normal` state). `[1m]`
    * Reset the text on the button back to +1 after the next click. `[1m]`

```swift
var timesPressed = 0
var reapeat = 1
var time = 0.0

public func viewDidLoad() {
    let label = UILabel()
    label.text = "Soh yong liang Sylvester"   /// 1m. BOD.
}

public func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
    for i in 1 ... (reapeat) {
        reapeat += 1
        time += 0.1
    }
    
    
}

public func onButtonPress() {
    timesPressed += 1
    label.text = String(timesPressed)   /// 1m
    if timesPressed == 17 {
        print("\(time)sec")   /// 1m
        let button = UIButton()
    }
}
```

> 3m. See answer sheet.
