### Section A

<details>
<summary><strong>A1. Variables and Constants â€¢ [5/5]</strong></summary>

1. Create a variable, called `rickrolls`, and set it to the number of times you have been rick-rolled by your fellow iOS teachers (any number works). `[1m]`

```swift
var rickrolls = 32
```

> 1m

---

2. Create a constant of the type `Double`, called `magicNumber`, and set it to `3`. `[2m]`

```swift
let magicNumber: Double = 3
```

> 2m

3. What is the difference between a variable and a constant? `[2m]`

```txt
"""
Answer: A variable is like a box because the data inside can be taken out and changed while a constant is like a vault because the data inside cannot be taken out and changed.
"""
```

<summary><strong>A3. Collections and Objects â€¢ [2/6]</strong></summary>

1. Define a structure (struct) called `Teacher` with the properties: `name`, `wearsGlasses`, and an **optional** value: `watchColor`, with the most appropriate types based on the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
struct Teacher {
    var name = "Ryan, Joe, Joshua, Ethan"
    var wearsGlasses = "Ryan, Joshua, Ethan"
    var watchColour = "Black, Pink, Grey"

2. Create an array called `teachers` containing multiple instances of `Teacher` using the details provided in the table above. `[2m]`

```swift
let arrayTeachers = ["Ryan, Joe, Joshua, Ethan"]
```

> 1m

---

3. For each `name` in the array declared previously, add `" is the best"` to the end of the `name`, and print it out individually. `[2m]`

<summary><strong>A4. FizzBuzz â€¢ [1/6]</strong></summary>

1. Create a function called `fizzBuzz` which takes a parameter `number` of type `Int` and returns a `String` ("Fizz", "Buzz", "FizzBuzz", or the number itself) based on the conditions above. Refer to the sample Input/Output. `[4m]`

```swift
func fizzBuzz (number:Int) {
    var fizzBuzz = true
    if number % 3 == 0 {
        fizzBuzz = false 
        print ("Fizz")
    }
    if number % 4 == 0 {
        fizzBuzz = false
        print ("Buzz")
    }
    
    if ((number % 3) != 0), 4 == 0 {
        fizzBuzz = true 
        print ("fizzBuzz")
    }
    
}
```

<summary><strong>B2. Leap Years â€¢ [5/9]</strong></summary>

1. Kesler's bugged code is shown below. There are **5 errors** present. Fix them. `[5m]`

    var isLeap = true
    // 'let' was changed to 'var '

        if year % 100 == 0 {
            isLeap = false
                // the line of code above was added
        }
            if isLeap = year % 400 == Int(0.0){
                isLeap = true
            }
                // int was added
        }

2. What is this feature called? How is it useful? How can Kesler get rid of it? `[2m]`

```txt
"""
Answer: Breakpoint. Breakspoints can be useful when you're checking through you code trying to fix errors. Kesler can get rid of it by right clicked the breakpoint and then deleting it.

3. What might have caused the SIGABRT error, assuming that the app ran fine before he edited his Storyboard? Is a SIGTERM error the same as a SIGABRT error? When does a SIGTERM error occur. `[2m]`

```txt
"""
Answer: When one of the connections gets deleted. A SIGTERM error is not the same as a SIGABRT error.

<summary><strong>B3. iClicker Pro Max Plus Ultra 5GS+ â€¢ [0/9]</strong></summary>

1. Label is to be set to your name when the program runs initially. `[1m]`
2. Border radius of the button is to be set to `15`. `[1m]`

4. Label should display the number of times the button has been clicked whenever the button is tapped. `[1m]`

    * Label should be set to the time in seconds since the first click, e.g. `"30s"`. `[2m]`
    * Text on the button is to be set to `"Yay"` (Hint: The correct answer requires setting text for the `.normal` state). `[1m]`
    * Reset the text on the button back to +1 after the next click. `[1m]`
