//: # B3. FizzBuzz â€¢ [6m]
//: FizzBuzz is a classic programming test, commonly used in coding interviews, to determine whether a given candidate is able to code.
//:
//: Your friend challenges you to complete a modified version of it, broken down into steps. The objectives are as follows:
//:
//: * Callout(Conditions):
//:     * For each multiple of 3, return "Fizz".
//:     * For each multiple of 4, return "Buzz".
//:     * For numbers which are multiples of both 3 **and** 4, return "FizzBuzz".
//:     * For numbers which do not adhere to the conditions previously stated, return the number itself as a `String`.
//:
//: 1. Create a function called `fizzBuzz()` which returns a `String` based on the conditions above. `[4m]`
