//: # Task 3 â€¢ 5 Marks
//: Kesler wrote the following function to check if it is a leap year. Something is wrong and he has asked you to help him fix it. *Being the president of SST Inc., he will reward you with 5 Marks if you successfully fix his code.*
//:
//: Here are the conditions for a leap year
//: - The year is a multiple of 4
//: - But if the year can is divisible by 100 it is not a leap year
//: - However, if it is divisible by 400, it is a leap year
//:
//: There are 5 errors below.
//:
//: This is what he sent you.
//: ```swift
//: func isLeap(year: Int) {
//:
//:     let isLeap = true
//:
//:     if year / 4 == 0 {
//:
//:         isLeap = true
//:
//:         if year % 100 == 0 {
//:
//:             isLeap = year % 400 == 0.0
//:
//:         }
//:     }
//:
//:     return isLeap
//: }
