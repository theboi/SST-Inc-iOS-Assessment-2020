//: # B1. School Gate â€¢ [7m]
//: Joe has been tasked to write an algorithm for a new school gate. To do so, he has to use variables and constants to store values.
//:
//: 1. What is the difference between variables and constants? `[2m]`

//: 2. Given a few variables, write a set of conditions that tell the gate whether or not to unlock. `[5m]`
//:
//: The school gate should unlock when **any** of the following conditions are met:
//:
//: * It is within operating hours **and** a student taps their pass.
//: * A teacher taps their pass.
//: * There is a fire.
//:
//: The following assumptions can also be made:
//:
//: * It is impossible for a person to have both a Student pass and a Teacher pass.
//: * The variable names describe the situation at a given moment.
