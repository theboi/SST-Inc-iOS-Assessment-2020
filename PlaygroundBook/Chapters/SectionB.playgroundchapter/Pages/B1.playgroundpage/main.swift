//: The school gate should unlock when **any** of the following conditions are met:
//:
//: * It is within operating hours **and** a student taps their pass.
//: * A teacher taps their pass.
//: * There is a fire.

//: The following assumptions can also be made:
//:
//: * It is impossible for a person to have both a Student pass and a Teacher pass.
//: * The variable names describe the situation at a given moment.
