//: # A4. FizzBuzz â€¢ [6m]
//: FizzBuzz is a classic programming test, commonly used in coding interviews, to determine whether a given candidate is able to code.
//:
//: - Important: The conditions are slightly modified from the classic FizzBuzz question.
//:
//: * Callout(Conditions):
//:     * Multiple of 3 -> "Fizz".
//:     * Multiple of 4 -> "Buzz".
//:     * Multiples of both 3 **and** 4 -> "FizzBuzz".
//:     * None of the above -> the number itself as a `String`.
//: 1. Create a function called `fizzBuzz()` which takes a parameter `number` of type `Int` and returns a `String` based on the conditions above. `[4m]`
